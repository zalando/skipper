# Skipper

Skipper is an HTTP router that acts as a reverse proxy (with support for flexible route definitions), alters
requests, and responses with filters. It:

- identifies routes based on the properties of the requests, such as path, method, host and headers
- routes each request to the configured server endpoint
- allows alteration of requests and responses with filters independently configured for each route
- optionally acts as a final endpoint (shunt)
- updates the routing rules without restarting, while supporting multiple types of data sources â€” including
  [Innkeeper](https://github.com/zalando/innkeeper), [etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd) and static files
- is extensible by custom filters and predicates

Skipper's design is largely inspired by [Vulcand](https://github.com/mailgun/vulcand).


### Quickstart

Skipper is 'go get' compatible. If needed, create a go workspace first:

    mkdir ws
    cd ws
    export GOPATH=$(pwd)
    export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin

Get the Skipper packages:

    go get github.com/zalando/skipper/...

Create a file with a route:

    echo 'hello: Path("/hello") -> "https://www.example.org"' > example.eskip

Optionally, verify the syntax of the file:

    eskip check example.eskip

Start Skipper and make an HTTP request through skipper:

    skipper -routes-file example.eskip &
    curl localhost:9090/hello


### Documentation

Skipper is documented in detail in godoc:
[https://godoc.org/github.com/zalando/skipper](https://godoc.org/github.com/zalando/skipper)


### Compiling

Getting the code (optionally, you can create a workspace):

    mkdir ws
    cd ws
    export GOPATH=$(pwd)
    export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
    go get -t github.com/zalando/skipper

Build:

    cd src/github.com/zalando/skipper
    go install ./cmd/skipper

Test:

    go test ./...
