/*
The following tests address the fade-in behavior expectations as observed from the perspective of the backend
endpoints of a single route.

Available data:
- fade-in configuration: this contains the fade-in duration and optionally the fade-in degree.
- detection time: this is the time when Skipper detected an endpoint that it didn't know about.
- created time, optional: this is external information about the created of an endpoint, when available. E.g.
  it can be the time when a Kubernetes pod became ready. It can be used as a fallback value for the detection
  time in cases when Skipper (re)starts. When present, it renders any detection time past this value as invalid.
- synced detection time, optional: it's the detection time of an endpoint shared across multiple Skipper
  instances, stored in Redis or shared as a Skipper swarm datagram. It can be used to continue the fade-in when
  Skipper gets (re)started. It has a precedence over the external created time in these cases.

States, all the combinations of:
- single or multiple proxy instances
- proxies with or without syncing (not implemented)
- zero, one or more endpoints
- endpoints with or without fade-in
- endpoints with or without available created time

Events:
- endpoint created
- endpoint detected
- endpoint restarted (not implemented)
- endpoint restarted fast (not implemented)
- endpoint deleted (not implemented)
- proxy (re)started (not implemented)
- proxy (re)started during fade-in (not implemented)
