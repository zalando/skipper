[tests]
TestProcessesFilterDefinitions timeout -> issue, seems like it may be related to time measure granularity on
ExampleClient_Update: sometimes fails, but the output shows no difference -> issue
different platforms

[doc]
update the readme.md
- etcd package needed for testing to the readme
- readme referencing godoc
proof read
usage of upstream and downstream?

remove notes.txt
reconsider what goes to options
remove custom tooling from .gitignore
oauth scopes missing from run.go
make the errors more diagnosable
remove debug tracing
buffer updates: benchmark and developer mode
check if registry type is used everywhere
header regexp matching and other todos
consider if the initial empty matcher is useful at all, document delay if needed
oauth takes credentials dir from env in the package, move dir parameter to options
race detection
raise the default poll timeout on the package level
vendoring
options reading to the run package
apply cmd changes
to the blog post: router in a single process app -> in microservices -> undefined number and type of
microservices
data client evaluation
etcd requested even when routes file set
in the notfound example, how is the status set?
benchmarking broken due to initializing during the first one
check if etcd getupdate doesn't leak
prefix options for given storage type
consider renaming the filters
use the existing fixed errors where applicable
