different platforms

remove notes.txt
reconsider what goes to options
remove custom tooling from .gitignore
oauth scopes missing from run.go
make the errors more diagnosable
remove debug tracing

check if registry type is used everywhere
header regexp matching and other todos
consider if the initial empty matcher is useful at all, document delay if needed
oauth takes credentials dir from env in the package, move dir parameter to options
race detection
raise the default poll timeout on the package level
vendoring
options reading to the run package
apply cmd changes
to the blog post: router in a single process app -> in microservices -> undefined number and type of
