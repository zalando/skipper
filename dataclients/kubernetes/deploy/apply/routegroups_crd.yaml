The request key is derived from `X-Forwarded-For` header or request remote IP address as the fallback. Use [`consistentHashKey`](filters.md#consistenthashkey) filter to set the request key. Use [`consistentHashBalanceFactor`](filters.md#consistenthashbalancefactor) to prevent popular keys from overloading a single backend endpoint.
                        `powerOfRandomNChoices` - backend is chosen by selecting N random endpoints and picking the one with least outstanding requests from them (see http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/handbook2001.pdf).

                        `service`- resolve Kubernetes service to the available Endpoints belonging to the Service, and generate load balanced routes using them.
                        `shunt` - reply directly from the proxy itself. This can be used to shortcut, for example have a default that replies with 404 or use skipper as a backend serving static content in demos.
                        `loopback` - lookup again the routing table to a better matching route after processing the current route. Like this you can add some headers or change the request path for some specific matching requests.
                        `dynamic` - use the backend provided by filters. This allows skipper as library users to do proxy calls to a certain target from their own implementation dynamically looked up by their filters.
                        `lb` - balance the load across multiple network endpoints using specified algorithm. If algorithm is not specified it will use the default algorithm set by Skipper at start.
                        `network` - use arbitrary HTTP or HTTPS URL.
