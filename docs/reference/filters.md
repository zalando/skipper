# Skipper Filters

The parameters can be strings, regex or float64 / int

* `string` is a string surrounded by double quotes (`"`)
* `regex` is a regular expression, surrounded by `/`, e.g. `/^www\.example\.org(:\d+)?$/`
* `int` / `float64` are usual (decimal) numbers like `401` or `1.23456`
* `time` is a string in double quotes, parseable by [time.Duration](https://godoc.org/time#ParseDuration))

Filters are a generic tool and can change HTTP header and body in the request and response path.
Filter can be chained using the arrow operator `->`.

Example route with a match all, 2 filters and a backend:

```
all: * -> filter1 -> filter2 -> "http://127.0.0.1:1234/";
```

## Template placeholders

Several filters support template placeholders (`${var}`) in string parameters.

Template placeholder is replaced by the value that is looked up in the following sources:

* request method (`${request.method}`)
* request host (`${request.host}`)
* request url path (`${request.path}`)
* request url rawquery (`${request.rawQuery}`, encoded request URL query without `?`, e.g. `q=foo&r=bar`)
* request url query (if starts with `request.query.` prefix, e.g `${request.query.q}` is replaced by `q` query parameter value)
* request headers (if starts with `request.header.` prefix, e.g `${request.header.Content-Type}` is replaced by `Content-Type` request header value)
* request cookies (if starts with `request.cookie.` prefix, e.g `${request.cookie.PHPSESSID}` is replaced by `PHPSESSID` request cookie value)
* request IP address
    - `${request.source}` - first IP address from `X-Forwarded-For` header or request remote IP address if header is absent, similar to [Source](predicates.md#source) predicate
    - `${request.sourceFromLast}` - last IP address from `X-Forwarded-For` header or request remote IP address if header is absent, similar to [SourceFromLast](predicates.md#sourcefromlast) predicate
    - `${request.clientIP}` - request remote IP address similar to [ClientIP](predicates.md#clientip) predicate
* response headers (if starts with `response.header.` prefix, e.g `${response.header.Location}` is replaced by `Location` response header value)
* filter context path parameters (e.g. `${id}` is replaced by `id` path parameter value)

Missing value interpretation depends on the filter.

Example route that rewrites path using template placeholder:

```
u1: Path("/user/:id") -> setPath("/v2/user/${id}") -> <loopback>;
```

Example route that creates header from query parameter:
```
r: Path("/redirect") && QueryParam("to") -> status(303) -> setResponseHeader("Location", "${request.query.to}") -> <shunt>;
```

## status

Sets the response status code to the given value, with no regards to the backend response.

Parameters:

* status code (int)

Example:

```
route1: Host(/^all401\.example\.org$/) -> status(401) -> <shunt>;
```

## comment

No operation, only to comment the route or a group of filters of a route

Parameters:

* msg (string)

Example:

```
route1: *
    -> comment("nothing to see")
    -> <shunt>;
```

## annotate

Annotate the route, subsequent annotations using the same key will overwrite the value.
Other subsequent filters can use annotations to make decisions and should document the key and value they use.

Parameters:

* key (string)
* value (string)

Example:

```
route1: *
    -> annotate("never", "gonna give you up")
    -> annotate("never", "gonna let you down")
    -> <shunt>;
```

## HTTP Headers
### preserveHost

Sets the incoming `Host: ` header on the outgoing backend connection.

It can be used to override the `proxyPreserveHost` behavior for individual routes.

Parameters: "true" or "false"

* "true" - use the Host header from the incoming request
* "false" - use the host from the backend address

Example:
```
route1: * -> preserveHost("true") -> "http://backend.example.org";
```

### modRequestHeader

Replace all matched regex expressions in the given header.

Parameters:

* header name (string)
* the expression to match (regex)
* the replacement (string)

Example:

```
enforce_www: * -> modRequestHeader("Host", "^zalando\.(\w+)$", "www.zalando.$1") -> redirectTo(301);
```

### setRequestHeader

Set headers for requests.

Header value may contain [template placeholders](#template-placeholders).
If a template placeholder can't be resolved then filter does not set the header.

Parameters:

* header name (string)
* header value (string)

Examples:

```
foo: * -> setRequestHeader("X-Passed-Skipper", "true") -> "https://backend.example.org";
```

```
// Ratelimit per resource
Path("/resource/:id") -> setRequestHeader("X-Resource-Id", "${id}") -> clusterClientRatelimit("resource", 10, "1m", "X-Resource-Id") -> "https://backend.example.org";
```

### appendRequestHeader

Same as [setRequestHeader](#setrequestheader),
but appends the provided value to the already existing ones.

### dropRequestHeader

Removes a header from the request

Parameters:

* header name (string)

Example:

```
foo: * -> dropRequestHeader("User-Agent") -> "https://backend.example.org";
```

### modResponseHeader

Same as [modRequestHeader](#modrequestheader), only for responses

Parameters:

* header name (string)
* the expression to match (regex)
* the replacement (string)

Example:

```
do_not_avoid_caching: * -> modResponseHeader("cache-control", "no-cache", "cache") -> "https://zalando.de";
```

### setResponseHeader

Same as [setRequestHeader](#setrequestheader), only for responses

Example:

```
set_cookie_with_path_param:
  Path("/path/:id") && Method("GET")
  -> setResponseHeader("Set-Cookie", "cid=${id}; Max-Age=36000; Secure")
  -> redirectTo(302, "/")
  -> <shunt>
```

### appendResponseHeader

Same as [appendRequestHeader](#appendrequestheader), only for responses

### dropResponseHeader

Same as [dropRequestHeader](#droprequestheader) but for responses from the backend

### setContextRequestHeader

Set headers for requests using values from the filter context (state bag). If the
provided key (second parameter) cannot be found in the state bag, then it doesn't
set the header.

Parameters:

* header name (string)
* key in the state bag (string)

The route in the following example checks whether the request is authorized with the
oauthTokeninfoAllScope() filter. This filter stores the authenticated user with "auth-user"
key in the context, and the setContextRequestHeader() filter in the next step stores it in
the header of the outgoing request with the X-Uid name:

```
foo: * -> oauthTokeninfoAllScope("address_service.all") -> setContextRequestHeader("X-Uid", "auth-user") -> "https://backend.example.org";
```

### appendContextRequestHeader

Same as [setContextRequestHeader](#setcontextrequestheader),
but appends the provided value to the already existing ones.

### setContextResponseHeader

Same as [setContextRequestHeader](#setcontextrequestheader), except for responses.

### appendContextResponseHeader

Same as [appendContextRequestHeader](#appendcontextrequestheader), except for responses.

### copyRequestHeader

Copies value of a given request header to another header.

Parameters:

* source header name (string)
* target header name (string)

Example:

```
foo: * -> copyRequestHeader("X-Foo", "X-Bar") -> "https://backend.example.org";
```

### copyResponseHeader

Same as [copyRequestHeader](#copyrequestheader), except for responses.

### corsOrigin

The filter accepts an optional variadic list of acceptable origin
parameters. If the input argument list is empty, the header will
always be set to `*` which means any origin is acceptable. Otherwise
the header is only set if the request contains an Origin header and
its value matches one of the elements in the input list. The header is
only set on the response.

Parameters:

*  url (variadic string)

Examples:

```
corsOrigin()
corsOrigin("https://www.example.org")
corsOrigin("https://www.example.org", "http://localhost:9001")
```

### headerToQuery

Filter which assigns the value of a given header from the incoming Request to a given query param

Parameters:

* The name of the header to pick from request
* The name of the query param key to add to request

Examples:

```
headerToQuery("X-Foo-Header", "foo-query-param")
```

The above filter will set `foo-query-param` query param respectively to the `X-Foo-Header` header
and will override the value if the queryparam exists already

### flowId

Sets an X-Flow-Id header, if it's not already in the request.
This allows you to have a trace in your logs, that traces from
the incoming request on the edge to all backend services.

Flow IDs must be in a certain format to be reusable in skipper. Valid formats
depend on the generator used in skipper. Default generator creates IDs of
length 16 matching the following regex: `^[0-9a-zA-Z+-]+$`

Parameters:

* no parameter: resets always the X-Flow-Id header to a new value
* `"reuse"`: only create X-Flow-Id header if not already set or if the value is invalid in the request

Example:

```
* -> flowId() -> "https://some-backend.example.org";
* -> flowId("reuse") -> "https://some-backend.example.org";
```

### xforward

Standard proxy headers. Appends the client remote IP to the X-Forwarded-For and sets the X-Forwarded-Host
header.

### xforwardFirst

Same as [xforward](#xforward), but instead of appending the last remote IP, it prepends it to comply with the
approach of certain LB implementations.


## HTTP Path
### modPath

Replace all matched regex expressions in the path.

Parameters:

* the expression to match (regex)
* the replacement (string)

Example:

```
rm_api: Path("/api") -> modPath("/api", "/") -> "https://backend.example.org";
append_bar: Path("/foo") -> modPath("/foo", "/foo/bar") -> "https://backend.example.org";
new_base: PathSubtree("/base") -> modPath("/base", "/new/base) -> "https://backend.example.org";
rm_api_regex: Path("/api") -> modPath("^/api/(.*)/v2$", "/$1") -> "https://backend.example.org";
```

### setPath

Replace the path of the original request to the replacement.

Parameters:

* the replacement (string)

The replacement may contain [template placeholders](#template-placeholders).
If a template placeholder can't be resolved then empty value is used for it.

## HTTP Redirect
### redirectTo

Creates an HTTP redirect response.

Parameters:

* redirect status code (int)
* location (string) - optional

Example:

```
redirect1: PathRegexp(/^\/foo\/bar/) -> redirectTo(302, "/foo/newBar") -> <shunt>;
redirect2: * -> redirectTo(301) -> <shunt>;
```

- Route redirect1 will do a redirect with status code 302 to https
  with new path `/foo/newBar` for requests, that match the path `/foo/bar`.
- Route redirect2 will do a `https` redirect with status code 301 for all
  incoming requests that match no other route

see also [redirect-handling](../tutorials/common-use-cases.md#redirect-handling)

### redirectToLower

Same as [redirectTo](#redirectto), but replaces all strings to lower case.

## HTTP Query
### stripQuery

Removes the query parameter from the request URL, and if the first filter
parameter is `"true"`, preserves the query parameter in the form of
`x-query-param-<queryParamName>: <queryParamValue>` headers, so that `?foo=bar`
becomes `x-query-param-foo: bar`

Example:
```
* -> stripQuery() -> "http://backend.example.org";
* -> stripQuery("true") -> "http://backend.example.org";
```

### setQuery

Set the query string `?k=v` in the request to the backend to a given value.

Parameters:

* key (string)
* value (string)

Key and value may contain [template placeholders](#template-placeholders).
If a template placeholder can't be resolved then empty value is used for it.

Example:

```
setQuery("k", "v")
```

### dropQuery

Delete the query string `?k=v` in the request to the backend for a
given key.

Parameters:

* key (string)

Key may contain [template placeholders](#template-placeholders).
If a template placeholder can't be resolved then empty value is used for it.

Example:

```
dropQuery("k")
```

### queryToHeader

Filter which assigns the value of a given query param from the
incoming Request to a given Header with optional format string value.

Parameters:

* The name of the query param key to pick from request
* The name of the header to add to request
* The format string used to create the header value, which gets the
  value from the query value as before

Examples:

```
queryToHeader("foo-query-param", "X-Foo-Header")
queryToHeader("access_token", "Authorization", "Bearer %s")
```

The first filter will set `X-Foo-Header` header respectively to the `foo-query-param` query param
and will not override the value if the header exists already.

The second filter will set `Authorization` header to the
`access_token` query param with a prefix value `Bearer ` and will
not override the value if the header exists already.

## TLS

Filters that provide access to TLS data of a request.

### tlsPassClientCertificates

This filter copies TLS client certificates encoded as pem into the
X-Forwarded-Tls-Client-Cert header. Multiple certificates are
separated by `,`.

Example:

```
* -> tlsPassClientCertificates() -> "http://10.2.5.21:8080";
```

## Diagnostics

These filters are meant for diagnostic or load testing purposes.

```
* -> randomContent(42) -> <shunt>;
```

### repeatContent

You may use https://github.com/AlexanderYastrebov/unrepeat to decompose binary file into prefix, repeating content and suffix.

### latency

Enable adding artificial latency

Parameters:

* latency in milliseconds (int) or in `time` as a string in double quotes, parseable by [time.Duration](https://godoc.org/time#ParseDuration))

Example:

```
* -> latency(120) -> "https://www.example.org";
* -> latency("120ms") -> "https://www.example.org";
```

### bandwidth

Enable bandwidth throttling.

Parameters:

* bandwidth in kb/s (int)

Example:

```
* -> bandwidth(30) -> "https://www.example.org";
```

### chunks

Enables adding chunking responses with custom chunk size with
artificial delays in between response chunks. To disable delays, set
the second parameter to "0".

Parameters:

* byte length (int)
* time duration (time.Duration)

Example:

```
* -> chunks(1024, "120ms") -> "https://www.example.org";
* -> chunks(1024, "0") -> "https://www.example.org";
```

### backendLatency

Same as [latency filter](#latency), but on the request path and not on
the response path.

### backendBandwidth

Same as [bandwidth filter](#bandwidth), but on the request path and not on
the response path.

### backendChunks

Same as [chunks filter](#chunks), but on the request path and not on
the response path.

### tarpit

The tarpit filter discards the request and respond with a never ending
stream of chunked response payloads. The goal is to consume the client
connection without letting the client know what is happening.

Parameters:

* time duration (time.Duration)

Example:

```
* -> tarpit("1s") -> <shunt>;
```

The example will send every second a chunk of response payload.

### absorb

The absorb filter reads and discards the payload of the incoming requests.
It logs with INFO level and a unique ID per request:

- the event of receiving the request
- partial and final events for consuming request payload and total consumed byte count
- the finishing event of the request
- any read errors other than EOF

### absorbSilent

The absorbSilent filter reads and discards the payload of the incoming requests. It only
logs read errors other than EOF.

### uniformRequestLatency

The uniformRequestLatency filter introduces uniformly distributed
jitter latency within `[mean-delta, mean+delta]` interval for
requests. The first parameter is the mean and the second is delta. In
the example we would sleep for `100ms+/-10ms`.

Example:

```
* -> uniformRequestLatency("100ms", "10ms") -> "https://www.example.org";
```

### normalRequestLatency

The normalRequestLatency filter introduces normally distributed jitter
latency with configured mean value for requests. The first parameter
is µ (mean) and the second is σ as in
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution.

Example:

```
* -> normalRequestLatency("10ms", "5ms") -> "https://www.example.org";
```

### histogramRequestLatency

The histogramRequestLatency adds latency to requests according to the histogram distribution.
It expects a list of interleaved duration strings and numbers that defines a histogram.
Duration strings define boundaries of consecutive buckets and numbers define bucket weights.
The filter randomly selects a bucket with probability equal to its weight divided by the sum of all bucket weights
(which must be non-zero) and then sleeps for a random duration in between bucket boundaries.

Example:

```
r: * -> histogramRequestLatency("0ms", 50, "5ms", 0, "10ms", 30, "15ms", 20, "20ms") -> "https://www.example.org";
```

The example above adds a latency
* between 0ms and 5ms to 50% of the requests
* between 5ms and 10ms to 0% of the requests
* between 10ms and 15ms to 30% of the requests
* and between 15ms and 20ms to 20% of the requests.

### uniformResponseLatency

The uniformResponseLatency filter introduces uniformly distributed
jitter latency within `[mean-delta, mean+delta]` interval for
responses. The first parameter is the mean and the second is delta. In
the example we would sleep for `100ms+/-10ms`.

Example:

```
* -> uniformRequestLatency("100ms", "10ms") -> "https://www.example.org";
```

### normalResponseLatency

The normalResponseLatency filter introduces normally distributed
jitter latency with configured mean value for responses. The first
parameter is µ (mean) and the second is σ as in
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution.

Example:

```
* -> normalRequestLatency("10ms", "5ms") -> "https://www.example.org";
```

### histogramResponseLatency

The histogramResponseLatency adds latency to responses according to the histogram distribution, similar to [histogramRequestLatency](#histogramrequestlatency).

### logHeader

The `logHeader` filter prints the request line and the header, but not the body, to
stderr. Note that this filter should be used only in diagnostics setup and with care,
since the request headers may contain sensitive data, and they also can explode the
amount of logs. Authorization headers will be truncated in request and
response header logs. You can log request or response headers, which
defaults for backwards compatibility to request headers.

Parameters:

* no arg, similar to: "request"
* "request" or "response" (string varargs)

Example:

```
* -> logHeader() -> "https://www.example.org";
* -> logHeader("request") -> "https://www.example.org";
* -> logHeader("response") -> "https://www.example.org";
* -> logHeader("request", "response") -> "https://www.example.org";
```

### logBody

The `logBody` filter logs the request or response body in chunks while
streaming. Chunks start with `logBody("request") $flowid: ` or
`logBody("response") $flowid: `, such that you can find all chunks
belonging to a given flow. See also [flowId()](#flowid) filter.

Note that this filter should be used only in diagnostics setup and
with care, since the request and response body may contain sensitive
data. Logs can also explode in the amount of bytes, so you have to
choose a limit. You can log request or response bodies. This filter
has close to no overhead other than the I/O created by the logger.

Parameters:

* type: "request" or "response" (string)
* limit: maximum number of bytes to log (int)

Example:

```
* -> logBody("request", 1024) -> "https://www.example.org";
* -> logBody("response", 1024) -> "https://www.example.org";
* -> logBody("request", 1024) -> logBody("response", 1024) -> "https://www.example.org";
```

## Timeout

### backendTimeout

Configure backend timeout. Skipper responds with `504 Gateway Timeout` status if obtaining a connection,
sending the request, and reading the backend response headers and body takes longer than the configured timeout.
However, if response streaming has already started it will be terminated, i.e. client will receive backend response
status and truncated response body.

Parameters:

* timeout [(duration string)](https://godoc.org/time#ParseDuration)

Example:

```
* -> backendTimeout("10ms") -> "https://www.example.org";
```

### readTimeout

Configure read timeout will set a read deadline on the server socket
connected to the client connecting to the proxy. Skipper will log 499
client timeout with context canceled. We are not able to differentiate
between client hang up and read timeout.

Parameters:

* timeout [(duration string)](https://godoc.org/time#ParseDuration)

Example:

```
* -> readTimeout("10ms") -> "https://www.example.org";
```

### writeTimeout

Configure write timeout will set a write deadline on the server socket
connected to the client connecting to the proxy. Skipper will show
access logs as if the response was served as expected, but the client can
show an error. You can observe an increase in streaming errors via
metrics or a in opentracing proxy span you can see Tag
`streamBody.byte` with value `streamBody error` or in debug logs
something like
`error while copying the response stream: write tcp 127.0.0.1:9090->127.0.0.1:38574: i/o timeout`.

Parameters:

* timeout [(duration string)](https://godoc.org/time#ParseDuration)

Example:

```
* -> writeTimeout("10ms") -> "https://www.example.org";
```


## Shadow Traffic
### tee

Provides a unix-like `tee` feature for routing.

Using this filter, the request will be sent to a "shadow" backend in addition
to the main backend of the route.

Example:

```
* -> tee("https://audit-logging.example.org") -> "https://foo.example.org";
```

This will send an identical request for foo.example.org to
audit-logging.example.org. Another use case could be using it for benchmarking
a new backend with some real traffic. This we call "shadow traffic".

The above route will forward the request to `https://foo.example.org` as it
normally would do, but in addition to that, it will send an identical request to
`https://audit-logging.example.org`. The request sent to
`https://audit-logging.example.org` will receive the same method and headers,
and a copy of the body stream. The `tee` response is ignored for this shadow backend.

It is possible to change the path of the tee request, in a similar way to the
[modPath](#modpath) filter:

```
Path("/api/v1") -> tee("https://api.example.org", "^/v1", "/v2" ) -> "http://api.example.org";
```

In the above example, one can test how a new version of an API would behave on
incoming requests.

### teenf

The same as [tee filter](#tee), but does not follow redirects from the backend.

### teeLoopback

This filter provides a unix-like tee feature for routing, but unlike the [tee](#tee),
this filter feeds the copied request to the start of the routing, including the
route lookup and executing the filters on the matched route.

It is recommended to use this solution instead of the tee filter, because the same
routing facilities are used for the outgoing tee requests as for the normal
requests, and all the filters and backend types are supported.

To ensure that the right route, or one of the right set of routes, is matched
after the loopback, use the filter together with the [Tee](predicates.md#tee)
predicate, however, this is not mandatory if the request is changed via other
filters, such that other predicates ensure matching the right route. To avoid
infinite looping, the number of requests spawn from a single incoming request
is limited similarly as in case of the
[loopback backend](backends.md#loopback-backend).

Parameters:

* tee group (string): a label identifying which routes should match the loopback
  request, marked with the [Tee](predicates.md#tee) predicate

Example, generate shadow traffic from 10% of the production traffic:

```
main: * -> "https://main-backend.example.org";
split: Traffic(.1) -> teeLoopback("test-A") -> "https://main-backend.example.org";
shadow: Tee("test-A") && True() -> "https://test-backend.example.org";
```

* [Tee predicate](predicates.md#tee)
* [Shadow Traffic Tutorial](../tutorials/shadow-traffic.md)

## HTTP Body
### compress

The filter, when executed on the response path, checks if the response entity can
be compressed. To decide, it checks the Content-Encoding, the Cache-Control and
the Content-Type headers. It doesn't compress the content if the Content-Encoding
is set to other than identity, or the Cache-Control applies the no-transform
pragma, or the Content-Type is set to an unsupported value.

The default supported content types are: `text/plain`, `text/html`, `application/json`,
`application/javascript`, `application/x-javascript`, `text/javascript`, `text/css`,
`image/svg+xml`, `application/octet-stream`.

The default set of MIME types can be reset or extended by passing in the desired
types as filter arguments. When extending the defaults, the first argument needs to
be `"..."`. E.g. to compress tiff in addition to the defaults:

```
* -> compress("...", "image/tiff") -> "https://www.example.org"
```

To reset the supported types, e.g. to compress only HTML, the "..." argument needs
to be omitted:

```
* -> compress("text/html") -> "https://www.example.org"
```

It is possible to control the compression level, by setting it as the first filter
argument, in front of the MIME types. The default compression level is best-speed.
The possible values are integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), where 0 means
no-compression, 1 means best-speed and 11 means best-compression. Example:

```
* -> compress(11, "image/tiff") -> "https://www.example.org"
```

The filter also checks the incoming request, if it accepts the supported encodings,
explicitly stated in the Accept-Encoding header.
The filter currently supports by default `gzip`, `deflate` and `br` (can be overridden with flag `compress-encodings`).
It does not assume that the client accepts any encoding if the
Accept-Encoding header is not set. It ignores * in the Accept-Encoding header.

Supported encodings are prioritized on:
- quality value provided by client
- compress-encodings flag following order as provided if quality value is equal
- `gzip`, `deflate`, `br` in this order otherwise

When compressing the response, it updates the response header. It deletes the
`Content-Length` value triggering the proxy to always return the response with chunked
transfer encoding, sets the Content-Encoding to the selected encoding and sets the
`Vary: Accept-Encoding` header, if missing.

The compression happens in a streaming way, using only a small internal buffer.

### decompress

The filter, when executed on the response path, checks if the response entity is
compressed by a supported algorithm (`gzip`, `deflate`, `br`). To decide, it checks the Content-Encoding
header.

When compressing the response, it updates the response header. It deletes the
`Content-Length` value triggering the proxy to always return the response with chunked
transfer encoding, deletes the Content-Encoding and the Vary headers, if set.

The decompression happens in a streaming way, using only a small internal buffer.

Example:

```
* -> decompress() -> "https://www.example.org"
```

### static

Serves static content from the filesystem.

Parameters:

* Request path to strip (string)
* Target base path in the filesystem (string)

Example:

This serves files from `/srv/www/dehydrated` when requested via `/.well-known/acme-challenge/`,
e.g. the request `GET /.well-known/acme-challenge/foo` will serve the file `/srv/www/dehydrated/foo`.
```
acme: Host(/./) && Method("GET") && Path("/.well-known/acme-challenge/*")
    -> static("/.well-known/acme-challenge/", "/srv/www/dehydrated") -> <shunt>;
```

Notes:

* redirects to the directory when a file `index.html` exists and it is requested, i.e. `GET /foo/index.html` redirects to `/foo/` which serves then the `/foo/index.html`
* serves the content of the `index.html` when a directory is requested
* does a simple directory listing of files / directories when no `index.html` is present

### inlineContent

Returns arbitrary content in the HTTP body.

Parameters:

* content (string)
* content type (string) - optional

Example:

```
* -> inlineContent("<h1>Hello</h1>") -> <shunt>
* -> inlineContent("[1,2,3]", "application/json") -> <shunt>
* -> status(418) -> inlineContent("Would you like a cup of tea?") -> <shunt>
```

Content type will be automatically detected when not provided using https://mimesniff.spec.whatwg.org/#rules-for-identifying-an-unknown-mime-type algorithm.
Note that content detection algorithm does not contain any rules for recognizing JSON.

!!! note
    `inlineContent` filter sets the response on request path and starts the response path immediately.
    The rest of the filter chain and backend are ignored and therefore `inlineContent` filter must be the last in the chain.

### inlineContentIfStatus

Returns arbitrary content in the HTTP body, if the response has the specified status code.

Parameters:

* status code (int)
* content (string)
* content type (string) - optional

Example:

```
* -> inlineContentIfStatus(404, "<p class=\"problem\">We don't have what you're looking for.</p>") -> "https://www.example.org"
* -> inlineContentIfStatus(401, "{\"error\": \"unauthorized\"}", "application/json") -> "https://www.example.org"
```

The content type will be automatically detected when not provided.

### blockContent

Block a request based on it's body content.

The filter max buffer size is 2MiB by default and can be overridden with `-max-matcher-buffer-size=<int>`.

Parameters:

* toblockList (List of strings)

Example:

```
* -> blockContent("Malicious Content") -> "http://example.com";
```

### blockContentHex

Block a request based on it's body content.

The filter max buffer size is 2MiB by default and can be overridden with `-max-matcher-buffer-size=<int>`.

Parameters:

* toblockList (List of hex string)

Example:

```
* -> blockContentHex(`000a`) -> "http://example.com";
* -> blockContentHex("deadbeef", "000a") -> "http://example.com";
```

### sed

The filter sed replaces all occurrences of a pattern with a replacement string
in the response body.

Example:

```
editorRoute: * -> sed("foo", "bar") -> "https://www.example.org";
```

Example with larger max buffer:

```
editorRoute: * -> sed("foo", "bar", 64000000) -> "https://www.example.org";
```

This filter expects a regexp pattern and a replacement string as arguments.
During the streaming of the response body, every occurrence of the pattern will
be replaced with the replacement string. The editing doesn't happen right when
the filter is executed, only later when the streaming normally happens, after
all response filters were called.

The sed() filter accepts two optional arguments, the max editor buffer size in
bytes, and max buffer handling flag. The max buffer size, when set, defines how
much data can be buffered at a given time by the editor. The default value is
2MiB. The max buffer handling flag can take one of two values: "abort" or
"best-effort" (default). Setting "abort" means that the stream will be aborted
when reached the limit. Setting "best-effort", will run the replacement on the
available content, in case of certain patterns, this may result in content that
is different from one that would have been edited in a single piece. See more
details below.

The filter uses the go regular expression implementation:
https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax . Due to the streaming nature, matches
with zero length are ignored.

#### Memory handling and limitations

In order to avoid unbound buffering of unprocessed data, the sed* filters need to
apply some limitations. Some patterns, e.g. `.*` would allow to match the complete
payload, and it could result in trying to buffer it all and potentially causing
running out of available memory. Similarly, in case of certain expressions, when
they don't match, it's impossible to tell if they would match without reading more
data from the source, and so would potentially need to buffer the entire payload.

To prevent too high memory usage, the max buffer size is limited in case of each
variant of the filter, by default to 2MiB, which is the same limit as the one we
apply when reading the request headers by default. When the limit is reached, and
the buffered content matches the pattern, then it is processed by replacing it,
when it doesn't match the pattern, then it is forwarded unchanged. This way, e.g.
`sed(".*", "")` can be used safely to consume and discard the payload.

As a result of this, with large payloads, it is possible that the resulting content
will be different than if we had run the replacement on the entire content at once.
If we have enough preliminary knowledge about the payload, then it may be better to
use the delimited variant of the filters, e.g. for line based editing.

If the max buffer handling is set to "abort", then the stream editing is stopped
and the rest of the payload is dropped.

### sedDelim

Like [sed()](#sed), but it expects an additional argument, before the optional max buffer
size argument, that is used to delimit chunks to be processed at once. The pattern
replacement is executed only within the boundaries of the chunks defined by the
delimiter, and matches across the chunk boundaries are not considered.

Example:

```
editorRoute: * -> sedDelim("foo", "bar", "\n") -> "https://www.example.org";
```

### sedRequest

Like [sed()](#sed), but for the request content.

Example:

```
editorRoute: * -> sedRequest("foo", "bar") -> "https://www.example.org";
```

### sedRequestDelim

Like [sedDelim()](#seddelim), but for the request content.

Example:

```
editorRoute: * -> sedRequestDelim("foo", "bar", "\n") -> "https://www.example.org";
```

## Authentication and Authorization
### basicAuth

Enable Basic Authentication

The filter accepts two parameters, the first mandatory one is the path to the
htpasswd file usually used with Apache or nginx. The second one is the optional
realm name that will be displayed in the browser. MD5, SHA1 and BCrypt are supported
for Basic authentication password storage, see also
[the http-auth module page](https://github.com/abbot/go-http-auth).

Examples:

```
basicAuth("/path/to/htpasswd")
basicAuth("/path/to/htpasswd", "My Website")
```

### webhook

The `webhook` filter makes it possible to have your own authentication and
authorization endpoint as a filter.

Headers from the incoming request will be copied into the request that
is being done to the webhook endpoint. It is possible to copy headers
from the webhook response into the continuing request by specifying the
headers to copy as an optional second argument to the filter.

Responses from the webhook will be treated as follows:

* Authorized if the status code is less than 300
* Forbidden if the status code is 403
* Unauthorized for remaining status codes

Examples:

```
webhook("https://custom-webhook.example.org/auth")
webhook("https://custom-webhook.example.org/auth", "X-Copy-Webhook-Header,X-Copy-Another-Header")
```

The webhook timeout has a default of 2 seconds and can be globally
changed, if skipper is started with `-webhook-timeout=2s` flag.

### Tokeninfo

Tokeninfo handled by another service.
The filters just validate the response from the tokeninfo
service to do authorization as defined in the filter.

#### oauthTokeninfoAnyScope

If skipper is started with `-oauth2-tokeninfo-url` flag, you can use
this filter.

The filter accepts variable number of string arguments, which are used to
validate the incoming token from the `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
header. There are two rejection scenarios for this filter. If the token
is not successfully validated by the oauth server, then a 401 Unauthorised
response will be returned. However, if the token is successfully validated
but the required scope match isn't satisfied, then a 403 Forbidden response
will be returned. If any of the configured scopes from the filter is found
inside the tokeninfo result for the incoming token, it will allow the
request to pass.

Examples:

```
oauthTokeninfoAnyScope("s1", "s2", "s3")
```

#### oauthTokeninfoAllScope

If skipper is started with `-oauth2-tokeninfo-url` flag, you can use
this filter.

The filter accepts variable number of string arguments, which are used to
validate the incoming token from the `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
header. There are two rejection scenarios for this filter. If the token
is not successfully validated by the oauth server, then a 401 Unauthorised
response will be returned. However, if the token is successfully validated
but the required scope match isn't satisfied, then a 403 Forbidden response
will be returned. If all of the configured scopes from the filter are found
inside the tokeninfo result for the incoming token, it will allow the
request to pass.

Examples:

```
oauthTokeninfoAllScope("s1", "s2", "s3")
```

#### oauthTokeninfoAnyKV

If skipper is started with `-oauth2-tokeninfo-url` flag, you can use
this filter.

The filter accepts an even number of variable arguments of type
string, which are used to validate the incoming token from the
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. There are two rejection scenarios
for this filter. If the token is not successfully validated by the oauth
server, then a 401 Unauthorised response will be returned. However,
if the token is successfully validated but the required scope match
isn't satisfied, then a 403 Forbidden response will be returned.
If any of the configured key value pairs from the filter is found
inside the tokeninfo result for the incoming token, it will allow
the request to pass.

Examples:

```
oauthTokeninfoAnyKV("k1", "v1", "k2", "v2")
oauthTokeninfoAnyKV("k1", "v1", "k1", "v2")
```

#### oauthTokeninfoAllKV

If skipper is started with `-oauth2-tokeninfo-url` flag, you can use
this filter.

The filter accepts an even number of variable arguments of type
string, which are used to validate the incoming token from the
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. There are two rejection
scenarios for this filter. If the token is not successfully validated
by the oauth server, then a 401 Unauthorised response will be
returned. However, if the token is successfully validated but
the required scope match isn't satisfied, then a 403 Forbidden response
will be returned. If all of the configured key value pairs from
the filter are found inside the tokeninfo result for the incoming
token, it will allow the request to pass.

Examples:

```
oauthTokeninfoAllKV("k1", "v1", "k2", "v2")
```

#### oauthTokeninfoValidate

> This filter is experimental and may change in the future, please see tests for example usage.

The filter obtains token info and allows request if there was no error
otherwise it responds with `401 Unauthorized` status and configured response body.

It does nothing if any preceding filter already validated the token or if route is annotated with configured annotations.

It is useful as a default filter to ensure each request has a valid token.
[jwtMetrics](#jwtmetrics) filter may be used to discover routes serving requests without a valid token.

The filter requires single string argument that is parsed as YAML.
For convenience use [flow style format](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#chapter-7-flow-style-productions).

Examples:

```
// without opt-out annotation validates the token
oauthTokeninfoValidate("{optOutAnnotations: [oauth.disabled], unauthorizedResponse: 'Authentication required, see https://auth.test/foo'}")
```

```
// with opt-out annotation does not validate the token
annotate("oauth.disabled", "this endpoint is public") ->
oauthTokeninfoValidate("{optOutAnnotations: [oauth.disabled], unauthorizedResponse: 'Authentication required, see https://auth.test/foo'}")
```


### Tokenintrospection

Tokenintrospection handled by another service.
The filters just validate the response from the tokenintrospection
service to do authorization as defined in the filter.

#### oauthTokenintrospectionAnyClaims

The filter accepts variable number of string arguments, which are used
to validate the incoming token from the `Authorization: Bearer
<token>` header. The first argument to the filter is the issuer URL,
for example `https://accounts.google.com`, that will be used as
described in [RFC Draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-discovery-06#section-5)
to find the configuration and for example supported claims.

If one of the configured and supported claims from the filter are
found inside the tokenintrospection (RFC7662) result for the incoming
token, it will allow the request to pass.

Examples:

```
oauthTokenintrospectionAnyClaims("https://accounts.google.com", "c1", "c2", "c3")
```

#### oauthTokenintrospectionAllClaims

The filter accepts variable number of string arguments, which are used
to validate the incoming token from the `Authorization: Bearer

If all of the configured and supported claims from the filter are
found inside the tokenintrospection (RFC7662) result for the incoming
token, it will allow the request to pass.

Examples:

```

```

### JWT
#### jwtValidation

The filter parses bearer jwt token from Authorization header and validates the signature using public keys
discovered via /.well-known/openid-configuration endpoint. Takes issuer url as single parameter.
The filter stores token claims into the state bag where they can be used by oidcClaimsQuery() or forwardTokenPart()


Examples:

```
jwtValidation("https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenantId}/v2.0")
```

#### jwtMetrics

> This filter is experimental and may change in the future, please see tests for example usage.

The filter parses (but does not validate) JWT token from `Authorization` request header on response path
and increments the following counters:

* `missing-token`: request does not have `Authorization` header
* `invalid-token-type`: `Authorization` header value is not a `Bearer` type
* `invalid-token`: `Authorization` header does not contain a JWT token
* `missing-issuer`: JWT token does not have `iss` claim
* `invalid-issuer`: JWT token does not have any of the configured issuers

Each counter name uses concatenation of request method, escaped hostname and response status as a prefix, e.g.:

```
jwtMetrics.custom.GET.example_org.200.invalid-token
```

and therefore requires approximately `count(HTTP methods) * count(Hosts) * count(Statuses) * 8` bytes of additional memory.

The filter does nothing if response status is 4xx or route is opt-out via annotation or state bag value.

The filter requires single string argument that is parsed as YAML.
For convenience use [flow style format](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#chapter-7-flow-style-productions).

Examples:

```
jwtMetrics("{issuers: ['https://example.com', 'https://example.org']}")

// opt-out by annotation
annotate("oauth.disabled", "this endpoint is public") ->
jwtMetrics("{issuers: ['https://example.com', 'https://example.org'], optOutAnnotations: [oauth.disabled]}")

// opt-out by state bag:
// oauthTokeninfo* and oauthGrant filters store token info in the state bag using "tokeninfo" key.
oauthTokeninfoAnyKV("foo", "bar") ->
jwtMetrics("{issuers: ['https://example.com', 'https://example.org'], optOutStateBag: [tokeninfo]}")
```


### Forward Token Data
#### forwardToken

The filter takes the header name as its first argument and sets header value to the
token info or token introspection result serialized as a JSON object.
To include only particular fields provide their names as additional arguments.

If this filter is used when there is no token introspection or token info data
then it does not have any effect.

Examples:

```
forwardToken("X-Tokeninfo-Forward")
forwardToken("X-Tokeninfo-Forward", "access_token", "token_type")
```

#### forwardTokenField

The filter takes a header name and a field as its first and second arguments. The corresponding field from the result of token info, token introspection or oidc user info is added as
corresponding header when the request is passed to the backend.

If this filter is used when there is no token introspection, token info or oidc user info data
then it does not have any effect.

To forward multiple fields filters can be sequenced

Examples:

```
forwardTokenField("X-Tokeninfo-Forward-Oid", "oid") -> forwardTokenField("X-Tokeninfo-Forward-Sub", "sub")
```

### OAuth2
#### oauthGrant

Enables authentication and authorization with an OAuth2 authorization code grant flow as
specified by [RFC 6749 Section 1.3.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.1).
Automatically redirects unauthenticated users to log in at their provider's authorization
endpoint. Supports token refreshing and stores access and refresh tokens in an encrypted
cookie. Supports credential rotation for the OAuth2 client ID and secret.

The filter consumes and drops the grant token request cookie to prevent it from leaking
to untrusted downstream services.

The filter will inject the OAuth2 bearer token into the request headers if the flag
`oauth2-access-token-header-name` is set.

The filter must be used in conjunction with the [grantCallback](#grantcallback) filter
where the OAuth2 provider can redirect authenticated users with an authorization code.
Skipper will make sure to add the `grantCallback` filter for you to your routes when
you pass the `-enable-oauth2-grant-flow` flag.

The filter may be used with the [grantClaimsQuery](#grantclaimsquery) filter to perform
authz and access control.

The filter also supports javascript login redirect stub that can be used e.g. to store location hash.
To enable the stub, add preceding [annotate](#annotate) filter with `oauthGrant.loginRedirectStub` key and
HTML content that will be served to the client instead of `307 Temporary Redirect` to the authorization URL.
The filter will replace `{{authCodeURL}}` placeholder in the content with the actual authorization URL.

See the [tutorial](../tutorials/auth.md#oauth2-authorization-grant-flow) for step-by-step
instructions.

Examples:

```
all:
    *
    -> oauthGrant()
    -> "http://localhost:9090";
```

```
single_page_app:
    *
    -> annotate("oauthGrant.loginRedirectStub", `
          <!doctype html>
          <html lang="en">
            <head>
              <title>Redirecting...</title>
              <script>
                if (window.location.hash !== null) {
                  localStorage.setItem('original-location-hash', window.location.hash);
                }
                window.location.replace('{{authCodeURL}}');
              </script>
            </head>
          </html>
    `)
    -> oauthGrant()
    -> "http://localhost:9090";
```

#### grantCallback

The filter accepts authorization codes as a result of an OAuth2 authorization code grant
flow triggered by [oauthGrant](#oauthgrant). It uses the code to request access and
refresh tokens from the OAuth2 provider's token endpoint.

Examples:

```
// The callback route is automatically added when the `-enable-oauth2-grant-flow`
// flag is passed. You do not need to register it yourself. This is the equivalent
// of the route that Skipper adds for you:
callback:
    Path("/.well-known/oauth2-callback")
    -> grantCallback()
    -> <shunt>;
```

Skipper arguments:

| Argument | Required? | Description |
| -------- | --------- | ----------- |
| `-oauth2-callback-path` | no | path of the Skipper route containing the `grantCallback()` filter. Example: `-oauth2-callback-path=/oauth/callback` |

#### grantLogout

The filter revokes the refresh and access tokens in the cookie set by
[oauthGrant](#oauthgrant) if `-oauth2-revoke-token-url` is configured.
It also deletes the cookie by setting the `Set-Cookie` response header
to an empty value after a successful token revocation.

Examples:

```
grantLogout()
```

Skipper arguments:

| Argument | Required? | Description |
| -------- | --------- | ----------- |
| `-oauth2-revoke-token-url` | no | URL of the OAuth2 provider's token revocation endpoint. Example: `-oauth2-revoke-token-url=https://identity.example.com/oauth2/revoke` |

#### grantClaimsQuery

The filter allows defining access control rules based on claims in a tokeninfo JSON
payload.

This filter is an alias for `oidcClaimsQuery` and functions identically to it.
See [oidcClaimsQuery](#oidcclaimsquery) for more information.

Examples:

```
oauthGrant() -> grantClaimsQuery("/path:@_:sub%\"userid\"")
oauthGrant() -> grantClaimsQuery("/path:scope.#[==\"email\"]")
```

Skipper arguments:

| Argument | Required? | Description |
| -------- | --------- | ----------- |
| `-oauth2-tokeninfo-subject-key` | **yes** | the key of the attribute containing the OAuth2 subject ID in the OAuth2 provider's tokeninfo JSON payload. Default: `uid`. Example: `-oauth2-tokeninfo-subject-key=sub` |

### OpenID Connect

To enable OpenID Connect filters use `-oidc-secrets-file` command line flag.

#### oauthOidcUserInfo

```
oauthOidcUserInfo("https://oidc-provider.example.com", "client_id", "client_secret",
    "http://target.example.com/subpath/callback", "email profile", "name email picture",
    "parameter=value", "X-Auth-Authorization:claims.email", "0")
```

The filter needs the following parameters:

* **OpenID Connect Provider URL** For example Google OpenID Connect is available on `https://accounts.google.com`
* **Client ID** This value is obtained from the provider upon registration of the application.
* **Client Secret**  Also obtained from the provider
* **Callback URL** The entire path to the callback from the provider on which the token will be received.
    It can be any value which is a subpath on which the filter is applied.
* **Scopes** The OpenID scopes separated by spaces which need to be specified when requesting the token from the provider.
* **Claims** The claims which should be present in the token returned by the provider.
* **Auth Code Options** (optional) Passes key/value parameters to a provider's authorization endpoint. The value can be dynamically set by a query parameter with the same key name if the placeholder `skipper-request-query` is used.
* **Upstream Headers** (optional) The upstream endpoint will receive these headers which values are parsed from the OIDC information. The header definition can be one or more header-query pairs, space delimited. The query syntax is [GJSON](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson/blob/master/SYNTAX.md).
* **SubdomainsToRemove** (optional, default "1") Configures number of subdomains to remove from the request hostname to derive OIDC cookie domain. By default one subdomain is removed, e.g. for the www.example.com request hostname the OIDC cookie domain will be example.com (to support SSO for all subdomains of the example.com). Configure "0" to use the same hostname. Note that value is a string.

#### oauthOidcAnyClaims

```
oauthOidcAnyClaims("https://oidc-provider.example.com", "client_id", "client_secret",
    "http://target.example.com/subpath/callback", "email profile", "name email picture",
    "parameter=value", "X-Auth-Authorization:claims.email")
```

The filter needs the following parameters:

* **OpenID Connect Provider URL** For example Google OpenID Connect is available on `https://accounts.google.com`
* **Client ID** This value is obtained from the provider upon registration of the application.
* **Client Secret**  Also obtained from the provider
* **Callback URL** The entire path to the callback from the provider on which the token will be received.
    It can be any value which is a subpath on which the filter is applied.
* **Scopes** The OpenID scopes separated by spaces which need to be specified when requesting the token from the provider.
* **Claims** Several claims can be specified and the request is allowed as long as at least one of them is present.
* **Auth Code Options** (optional) Passes key/value parameters to a provider's authorization endpoint. The value can be dynamically set by a query parameter with the same key name if the placeholder `skipper-request-query` is used.
* **Upstream Headers** (optional) The upstream endpoint will receive these headers which values are parsed from the OIDC information. The header definition can be one or more header-query pairs, space delimited. The query syntax is [GJSON](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson/blob/master/SYNTAX.md).
* **SubdomainsToRemove** (optional, default "1") Configures number of subdomains to remove from the request hostname to derive OIDC cookie domain. By default one subdomain is removed, e.g. for the www.example.com request hostname the OIDC cookie domain will be example.com (to support SSO for all subdomains of the example.com). Configure "0" to use the same hostname. Note that value is a string.

#### oauthOidcAllClaims

```
oauthOidcAllClaims("https://oidc-provider.example.com", "client_id", "client_secret",
    "http://target.example.com/subpath/callback", "email profile", "name email picture",
    "parameter=value", "X-Auth-Authorization:claims.email")
```

The filter needs the following parameters:

* **OpenID Connect Provider URL** For example Google OpenID Connect is available on `https://accounts.google.com`
* **Client ID** This value is obtained from the provider upon registration of the application.
* **Client Secret**  Also obtained from the provider
* **Callback URL** The entire path to the callback from the provider on which the token will be received.
    It can be any value which is a subpath on which the filter is applied.
* **Scopes** The OpenID scopes separated by spaces which need to be specified when requesting the token from the provider.
* **Claims** Several claims can be specified and the request is allowed only when all claims are present.
* **Auth Code Options** (optional) Passes key/value parameters to a provider's authorization endpoint. The value can be dynamically set by a query parameter with the same key name if the placeholder `skipper-request-query` is used.
* **Upstream Headers** (optional) The upstream endpoint will receive these headers which values are parsed from the OIDC information. The header definition can be one or more header-query pairs, space delimited. The query syntax is [GJSON](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson/blob/master/SYNTAX.md).
* **SubdomainsToRemove** (optional, default "1") Configures number of subdomains to remove from the request hostname to derive OIDC cookie domain. By default one subdomain is removed, e.g. for the www.example.com request hostname the OIDC cookie domain will be example.com (to support SSO for all subdomains of the example.com). Configure "0" to use the same hostname. Note that value is a string.

#### oidcClaimsQuery

```
oidcClaimsQuery("<path>:[<query>]", ...)
```

The filter is chained after `oauthOidc*` authentication as it parses the ID token that has been saved in the internal `StateBag` for this request. It validates access control of the requested path against the defined query.
It accepts one or more arguments, that is a path prefix which is granted access to when the query definition evaluates positive.
It supports exact matches of keys, key-value pairs, introspecting of arrays or exact and wildcard matching of nested structures.
The query definition can be one or more queries per path, space delimited. The query syntax is [GJSON](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson/blob/master/SYNTAX.md) with a convenience modifier of `@_` which unfolds to `[@this].#("+arg+")`

Given following example ID token:

```json
{
  "email": "someone@example.org",
  "groups": [
    "CD-xyz",
    "appX-Test-Users",
    "Purchasing-Department"
  ],
  "name": "Some One"
}
```

Access to path `/` would be granted to everyone in `example.org`, however path `/login` only to those being member of `group "appX-Tester"`:

```
oauthOidcAnyClaims(...) -> oidcClaimsQuery("/login:groups.#[==\"appX-Tester\"]", "/:@_:email%\"*@example.org\"")
```

For above ID token following query definitions would also be positive:

```
oidcClaimsQuery("/:email")
oidcClaimsQuery("/another/path:groups.#[%\"CD-*\"]")
oidcClaimsQuery("/:name%\"*One\"", "/path:groups.#[%\"*-Test-Users\"] groups.#[==\"Purchasing-Department\"]")
```

As of now there is no negative/deny rule possible. The first matching path is evaluated against the defined query/queries and if positive, permitted.

### Open Policy Agent

To get started with [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/), also have a look at the [tutorial](../tutorials/auth.md#open-policy-agent). This section is only a reference for the implemented filters.

#### opaAuthorizeRequest

The canonical use case that is also implemented with [Envoy External Authorization](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_filters/ext_authz_filter): Use the http request to evaluate if Skipper should deny the request (with customizable response) or let the request pass to the downstream service

Example:

```
opaAuthorizeRequest("my-app-id")
```

Example (passing context):
```
opaAuthorizeRequest("my-app-id", "com.mydomain.xxx.myprop: myvalue")
```

*Data Flows*

The data flow in case the policy allows the request looks like this

```ascii
             ┌──────────────────┐               ┌────────────────────┐
 (1) Request │     Skipper      │ (4) Request   │ Target Application │
─────────────┤                  ├──────────────►│                    │
             │                  │               │                    │
 (6) Response│   (2)│   ▲ (3)   │ (5) Response  │                    │
◄────────────┤Req ->│   │ allow │◄──────────────┤                    │
             │Input │   │       │               │                    │
             ├──────┴───┴───────┤               └────────────────────┘
             │Open Policy Agent │
             │      │   │       │
             │      │   │       │
             │      │   │       │
             │      ▼   │       │
             │ ┌────────┴─────┐ │
             │ │   Policy     │ │
             │ └──────────────┘ │
             │                  │
             └──────────────────┘

```

In Step (2) the http request is transformed into an input object following the [Envoy structure](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/service/auth/v3/external_auth.proto#service-auth-v3-checkrequest) that is also used by the OPA Envoy plugin. In (3) the decision of the policy is evaluated. If it is equivalent to an "allow", the remaining steps are executed as without the filter.

The data flow in case the policy disallows the request looks like this

```ascii
             ┌──────────────────┐               ┌────────────────────┐
 (1) Request │     Skipper      │               │ Target Applicatio  │
─────────────┤                  ├──────────────►│                    │
             │                  │               │                    │
 (4) Response│   (2)│   ▲ (3)   │               │                    │
◄────────────┤Req ->│   │ allow │◄──────────────┤                    │
             │Input │   │ =false│               │                    │
             ├──────┴───┴───────┤               └────────────────────┘
             │Open Policy Agent │
             │      │   │       │
             │      │   │       │
             │      │   │       │
             │      ▼   │       │
             │ ┌────────┴─────┐ │
             │ │   Policy     │ │
             │ └──────────────┘ │
             │                  │
             └──────────────────┘

```

The difference is that if the decision in (3) is equivalent to false, the response is handled directly from the filter. If the decision contains response body, status or headers those are used to build the response in (6) otherwise a 403 Forbidden with a generic body is returned.

*Manipulating Request Headers*

Headers both to the upstream and the downstream service can be manipulated the same way this works for [Envoy external authorization](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/envoy-primer/#example-policy-with-additional-controls)

This allows both to add and remove unwanted headers in allow/deny cases.

#### opaAuthorizeRequestWithBody

Requests can also be authorized based on the request body the same way that is supported with the [Open Policy Agent Envoy plugin](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/envoy-primer/#example-input), look for the input attribute `parsed_body` in the upstream documentation.

This filter has the same parameters that the `opaAuthorizeRequest` filter has.

A request's body is parsed up to a maximum size with a default of 1MB that can be configured via the `-open-policy-agent-max-request-body-size` command line argument. To avoid OOM errors due to too many concurrent authorized body requests, another flag `-open-policy-agent-max-memory-body-parsing` controls how much memory can be used across all requests with a default of 100MB. If in-flight requests that use body authorization exceed that limit, incoming requests that use the body will be rejected with an internal server error. The number of concurrent requests is

$$ n_{max-memory-body-parsing} \over min(avg(n_{request-content-length}), n_{max-request-body-size}) $$

so if requests on average have 100KB and the maximum memory is set to 100MB, on average 1024 authorized requests can be processed concurrently.

The filter also honors the `skip-request-body-parse` of the corresponding [configuration](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/envoy-introduction/#configuration) that the OPA plugin uses.

#### opaServeResponse

Always serves the response even if the policy allows the request and can customize the response completely. Can be used to re-implement legacy authorization services by already using data in Open Policy Agent but implementing an old REST API. This can also be useful to support Single Page Applications to return the calling users' permissions.

*Hint*: As there is no real allow/deny in this case and the policy computes the http response, you typically will want to [drop all decision logs](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/management-decision-logs/#drop-decision-logs)

Example:

```
opaServeResponse("my-app-id")
```

Example (passing context):
```
opaServeResponse("my-app-id", "com.mydomain.xxx.myprop: myvalue")
```

*Data Flows*

For this filter, the data flow looks like this independent of an allow/deny decision

```ascii
             ┌──────────────────┐
 (1) Request │     Skipper      │
─────────────┤                  ├
             │                  │
 (4) Response│   (2)│   ▲ (3)   │
◄────────────┤Req ->│   │ resp  │
             │Input │   │       │
             ├──────┴───┴───────┤
             │Open Policy Agent │
             │      │   │       │
             │      │   │       │
             │      │   │       │
             │      ▼   │       │
             │ ┌────────┴─────┐ │
             │ │   Policy     │ │
             │ └──────────────┘ │
             │                  │
             └──────────────────┘

```

#### opaServeResponseWithReqBody

If you want to serve requests directly from an Open Policy Agent policy that uses the request body, this can be done by using the `input.parsed_body` attribute the same way that is supported with the [Open Policy Agent Envoy plugin](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/envoy-primer/#example-input).

This filter has the same parameters that the `opaServeResponse` filter has.

A request's body is parsed up to a maximum size with a default of 1MB that can be configured via the `-open-policy-agent-max-request-body-size` command line argument. To avoid OOM errors due to too many concurrent authorized body requests, another flag `-open-policy-agent-max-memory-body-parsing` controls how much memory can be used across all requests with a default of 100MB. If  in-flight requests that use body authorization exceed that limit, incoming requests that use the body will be rejected with an internal server error. The number of concurrent requests is

$$ n_{max-memory-body-parsing} \over min(avg(n_{request-content-length}), n_{max-request-body-size}) $$

so if requests on average have 100KB and the maximum memory is set to 100MB, on average 1024 authorized requests can be processed concurrently.

The filter also honors the `skip-request-body-parse` of the corresponding [configuration](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/envoy-introduction/#configuration) that the OPA plugin uses.

## Cookie Handling
### dropRequestCookie

Deletes given cookie from the request header.

Parameters:

* cookie name (string)

Example:

```
dropRequestCookie("test-session")
```

### dropResponseCookie

Deletes given cookie from the response header.

Parameters:

* cookie name (string)

Example:

```
dropResponseCookie("test-session")
```

### requestCookie

Append a cookie to the request header.

Parameters:

* cookie name (string)
* cookie value (string)

Example:

```
requestCookie("test-session", "abc")
```

### responseCookie

Appends a cookie to the response via "Set-Cookie" header.
It derives cookie domain by removing one subdomain from the request hostname domain.
The filter accepts an optional argument to set the `Max-Age` attribute of the cookie, of type `int`, in seconds.
Use zero to expire the cookie immediately.
An optional fourth argument, "change-only", controls if the cookie should be set on every
response, or only if the request does not contain a cookie with the provided
name and value.

Example:

```
responseCookie("test-session", "abc")
responseCookie("test-session", "abc", 31536000),
responseCookie("test-session", "abc", 31536000, "change-only")
responseCookie("test-session", "deleted", 0),
```

### jsCookie

The JS cookie behaves exactly as the response cookie, but it does not set the
`HttpOnly` directive, so these cookies will be accessible from JS code running
in web browsers.

Example:

```
jsCookie("test-session-info", "abc-debug", 31536000, "change-only")
```

## Circuit Breakers
### consecutiveBreaker

This breaker opens when the proxy could not connect to a backend or received
a >=500 status code at least N times in a row. When open, the proxy returns
503 - Service Unavailable response during the breaker timeout. After this timeout,
the breaker goes into half-open state, in which it expects that M number of
requests succeed. The requests in the half-open state are accepted concurrently.
If any of the requests during the half-open state fails, the breaker goes back to
open state. If all succeed, it goes to closed state again.

Parameters:

* number of consecutive failures to open (int)
* timeout (time string, parseable by [time.Duration](https://godoc.org/time#ParseDuration)) - optional
* half-open requests (int) - optional
* idle-ttl (time string, parseable by [time.Duration](https://godoc.org/time#ParseDuration)) - optional

See also the [circuit breaker docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/zalando/skipper/circuit).

Can be used as [egress](egress.md) feature.

### rateBreaker

The "rate breaker" works similar to the [consecutiveBreaker](#consecutivebreaker), but
instead of considering N consecutive failures for going open, it maintains a sliding
window of the last M events, both successes and failures, and opens only when the number
of failures reaches N within the window. This way the sliding window is not time based
and allows the same breaker characteristics for low and high rate traffic.

Parameters:

* number of consecutive failures to open (int)
* sliding window (int)
* timeout (time string, parseable by [time.Duration](https://godoc.org/time#ParseDuration)) - optional
* half-open requests (int) - optional
* idle-ttl (time string, parseable by [time.Duration](https://godoc.org/time#ParseDuration)) - optional

See also the [circuit breaker docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/zalando/skipper/circuit).

Can be used as [egress](egress.md) feature.

### disableBreaker

Change (or set) the breaker configurations for an individual route and disable for another, in eskip:

```
updates: Method("POST") && Host("foo.example.org")
  -> consecutiveBreaker(9)
  -> "https://foo.backend.net";

backendHealthcheck: Path("/healthcheck")
  -> disableBreaker()
  -> "https://foo.backend.net";
```

See also the [circuit breaker docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/zalando/skipper/circuit).

Can be used as [egress](egress.md) feature.

## Rate Limit

### <del>localRatelimit</del>

**DEPRECATED** use [clientRatelimit](#clientratelimit) with the same
  settings instead.

### clientRatelimit

Per skipper instance calculated ratelimit, that allows number of
requests by client. The definition of the same client is based on data
of the http header and can be changed with an optional third
parameter. If the third parameter is set skipper will use the
defined HTTP header to put the request in the same client bucket,
else the X-Forwarded-For Header will be used. You need to run skipper
with command line flag `-enable-ratelimits`.

One filter consumes memory calculated by the following formula, where
N is the number of individual clients put into the same bucket, M the
maximum number of requests allowed:

```
memory = N * M * 15 byte
```

Memory usage examples:

- 5MB   for M=3  and N=100000
- 15MB  for M=10 and N=100000
- 150MB for M=100 and N=100000

Parameters:

* number of allowed requests per time period (int)
* time period for requests being counted (time.Duration)
* optional parameter to set the same client by header, in case the provided string contains `,`, it will combine all these headers (string)

```
clientRatelimit(3, "1m")
clientRatelimit(3, "1m", "Authorization")
clientRatelimit(3, "1m", "X-Foo,Authorization,X-Bar")
```

See also the [ratelimit docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/zalando/skipper/ratelimit).

### ratelimit

Per skipper instance calculated ratelimit, that allows forwarding a
number of requests to the backend group. You need to run skipper with
command line flag `-enable-ratelimits`.

Parameters:

* number of allowed requests per time period (int)
* time period for requests being counted (time.Duration)
* response status code to use for a rate limited request - optional, default: 429

```
ratelimit(20, "1m")
ratelimit(300, "1h")

### clusterClientRatelimit

This ratelimit is calculated across all skipper peers and the same
rate limit group. The first parameter is a string to select the same
ratelimit group across one or more routes.
The rate limit group allows the given number of requests by client.
The client identity is derived from the value of the `X-Forwarded-For` header or client IP address
and can be changed with an optional fourth parameter.
The optional fourth parameter may specify comma-separated list of header names.
Skipper will join header values to obtain client identity.
If identity value is empty (i.e. when all header values are empty or missing) then ratelimit does not apply.

You need to run skipper with command line flags `-enable-swarm` and
`-enable-ratelimits`. See also our [cluster ratelimit tutorial](../tutorials/ratelimit.md#cluster-ratelimit)

Parameters:

* rate limit group (string)
* number of allowed requests per time period (int)
* time period for requests being counted (time.Duration)
* optional parameter to set the same client by header, in case the provided string contains `,`, it will combine all these headers (string)

```
clusterClientRatelimit("groupA", 10, "1h")
clusterClientRatelimit("groupA", 10, "1h", "Authorization")
clusterClientRatelimit("groupA", 10, "1h", "X-Forwarded-For,Authorization,User-Agent")
```

See also the [ratelimit docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/zalando/skipper/ratelimit).

### clusterRatelimit

This ratelimit is calculated across all skipper peers and the same
rate limit group. The first parameter is a string to select the same
ratelimit group across one or more routes.  The rate limit group
allows the given number of requests to a backend.

You need to run skipper with command line flags `-enable-swarm` and
`-enable-ratelimits`. See also our [cluster ratelimit tutorial](../tutorials/ratelimit.md#cluster-ratelimit)


Parameters:

* rate limit group (string)
* number of allowed requests per time period (int)
* time period for requests being counted (time.Duration)
* response status code to use for a rate limited request - optional, default: 429

```
clusterRatelimit("groupB", 20, "1m")
clusterRatelimit("groupB", 300, "1h")
clusterRatelimit("groupB", 4000, "1m", 503)
```

See also the [ratelimit docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/zalando/skipper/ratelimit).

### backendRatelimit

The filter configures request rate limit for each backend endpoint within rate limit group across all Skipper peers.
When limit is reached Skipper refuses to forward the request to the backend and
responds with `503 Service Unavailable` status to the client, i.e. implements _load shedding_.

It is similar to [clusterClientRatelimit](#clusterclientratelimit) filter but counts request rate
using backend endpoint address instead of incoming request IP address or a HTTP header.
Requires command line flags `-enable-swarm` and `-enable-ratelimits`.

Both _rate limiting_ and _load shedding_ can use the exact same mechanism to protect the backend but the key difference is the semantics:

* _rate limiting_ should adopt 4XX and inform the client that they are exceeding some quota. It doesn't depend on the current capacity of the backend.
* _load shedding_ should adopt 5XX and inform the client that the backend is not able to provide the service. It depends on the current capacity of the backend.

Parameters:

* rate limit group (string)
* number of allowed requests per time period (int)
* timeframe for requests being counted (time.Duration)
* response status code to use for rejected requests - optional, default: 503

Multiple filter definitions using the same group must use the same number of allowed requests and timeframe values.

Examples:

```
foo: Path("/foo")
  -> backendRatelimit("foobar", 100, "1s")
  -> <"http://backend1", "http://backend2">;

bar: Path("/bar")
  -> backendRatelimit("foobar", 100, "1s")
  -> <"http://backend1", "http://backend2">;
```
Configures rate limit of 100 requests per second for each `backend1` and `backend2`
regardless of the request path by using the same group name, number of request and timeframe parameters.

```
foo: Path("/foo")
  -> backendRatelimit("foo", 40, "1s")
  -> <"http://backend1", "http://backend2">;

bar: Path("/bar")
  -> backendRatelimit("bar", 80, "1s")
  -> <"http://backend1", "http://backend2">;
```
Configures rate limit of 40 requests per second for each `backend1` and `backend2`
for the `/foo` requests and 80 requests per second for the `/bar` requests by using different group name per path.
The total request rate each backend receives can not exceed `40+80=120` requests per second.

```
foo: Path("/baz")
  -> backendRatelimit("baz", 100, "1s", 429)
  -> <"http://backend1", "http://backend2">;
```
Configures rate limit of 100 requests per second for each `backend1` and `backend2` and responds
with `429 Too Many Requests` when limit is reached.

### clusterLeakyBucketRatelimit

Implements leaky bucket rate limit algorithm that uses Redis as a storage.
Requires command line flags `-enable-ratelimits`, `-enable-swarm` and `-swarm-redis-urls` to be set.

The leaky bucket is an algorithm based on an analogy of how a bucket with a constant leak will overflow if either
the average rate at which water is poured in exceeds the rate at which the bucket leaks or if more water than
the capacity of the bucket is poured in all at once, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket

Parameters:

* label (string)
* leak rate volume (int)
* leak rate period (time.Duration)
* capacity (int)
* increment (int)

The bucket label, leak rate (volume/period) and capacity uniquely identify the bucket.

Label supports [template placeholders](#template-placeholders).
If a template placeholder can't be resolved then request is allowed and does not add to any bucket.

Leak rate (divided by increment) defines a maximum average allowed request rate.
The rate is configured by two parameters for convenience and consistency with other filters but is actually a single number,
e.g. the rate of 2 per second equals to the rate of 20 per 10 seconds or 120 per minute.

Capacity defines the maximum request burst size or an allowed jitter.

Each passing request adds increment amount to the bucket, different routes may add different amounts to the same bucket.

Configuration with equal capacity and increment allows no jitter: first request fills up the bucket full and
subsequent request will be rejected if it arrives earlier than `emission interval = 1/leak rate`.

Real requests always have a jitter which can be demonstrated by the configuration having capacity and increment of one:
```
r1: * -> clusterLeakyBucketRatelimit("1rps", 1, "1s", 1, 1) -> status(200) -> <shunt>;
```
it does not allow jitter and therefore rejects ~half of the requests coming at rate of 1 rps:
```
$ echo "GET http://localhost:9090" | vegeta attack -rate=1/s -duration=1m | vegeta report
Requests      [total, rate, throughput]  60, 1.02, 0.58
Duration      [total, attack, wait]      59.001991855s, 59.000310522s, 1.681333ms
Latencies     [mean, 50, 95, 99, max]    1.721207ms, 1.555227ms, 1.943115ms, 10.689486ms, 11.538278ms
Bytes In      [total, mean]              0, 0.00
Bytes Out     [total, mean]              0, 0.00
Success       [ratio]                    56.67%
Status Codes  [code:count]               200:34  429:26
Error Set:
429 Too Many Requests
```

On the other hand the configuration with capacity greater than increment:
```
r1: * -> clusterLeakyBucketRatelimit("1rps2", 1, "1s", 2, 1) -> status(200) -> <shunt>;
```
allows all requests:
```
~$ echo "GET http://localhost:9090" | vegeta attack -rate=1/s -duration=1m | vegeta report
Requests      [total, rate, throughput]  60, 1.02, 1.02
Duration      [total, attack, wait]      59.00023518s, 58.999779118s, 456.062µs
Latencies     [mean, 50, 95, 99, max]    1.410641ms, 1.585908ms, 1.859727ms, 8.285963ms, 8.997149ms
Bytes In      [total, mean]              0, 0.00
Bytes Out     [total, mean]              0, 0.00
Success       [ratio]                    100.00%
Status Codes  [code:count]               200:60
Error Set:
```
and even if rate is greater than 1 rps the average allowed request rate is still equal to the leak rate of 1 rps:
```
$ echo "GET http://localhost:9090" | vegeta attack -rate=11/10s -duration=1m | vegeta report
Requests      [total, rate, throughput]  66, 1.12, 1.03
Duration      [total, attack, wait]      59.091880389s, 59.089985762s, 1.894627ms
Latencies     [mean, 50, 95, 99, max]    1.709568ms, 1.60613ms, 1.925731ms, 10.601822ms, 12.10052ms
Bytes In      [total, mean]              0, 0.00
Bytes Out     [total, mean]              0, 0.00
Success       [ratio]                    92.42%
Status Codes  [code:count]               200:61  429:5
Error Set:
429 Too Many Requests
```

Therefore the capacity should be configured greater than increment unless strict request interval needs to be enforced.
Configuration having capacity below increment rejects all requests.

Examples:
```
// allow each unique Authorization header once in five seconds
clusterLeakyBucketRatelimit("auth-${request.header.Authorization}", 1, "5s", 2, 1)

// allow 60 requests per hour (each subsequent request allowed not earlied than after 1h/60 = 1m) for all clients
clusterLeakyBucketRatelimit("hourly", 60, "1h", 1, 1)

// allow 10 requests per minute for each unique PHPSESSID cookie with bursts of up to 5 requests
clusterLeakyBucketRatelimit("session-${request.cookie.PHPSESSID}", 10, "1m", 5, 1)

// use the same bucket but add different amount (i.e. one /expensive request counts as two /cheap)
Path("/cheap")     -> clusterLeakyBucketRatelimit("user-${request.cookie.Authorization}", 1, "1s", 5, 1) -> ...
Path("/expensive") -> clusterLeakyBucketRatelimit("user-${request.cookie.Authorization}", 1, "1s", 5, 2) -> ...
```

### ratelimitFailClosed

This filter changes the failure mode for all rate limit filters of the route.
By default rate limit filters fail open on infrastructure errors (e.g. when redis is down) and allow requests.
When this filter is present on the route, rate limit filters will fail closed in case of infrastructure errors and deny requests.

Examples:
```
fail_open: * -> clusterRatelimit("g",10, "1s")
fail_closed: * -> ratelimitFailClosed() -> clusterRatelimit("g", 10, "1s")
```

In case `clusterRatelimit` could not reach the swarm (e.g. redis):

* Route `fail_open` will allow the request
* Route `fail_closed` will deny the request

## Load Shedding

The basic idea of load shedding is to reduce errors by early stopping
some of the ingress requests that create too much load and serving
the maximum throughput the system can process at a point in time.

There is a great talk by [Acacio Cruz from
Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNEIkivvaV4)
that explains the basic principles.

### admissionControl

Implements an admission control filter, that rejects traffic by
observed error rate and probability. If it rejects a request skipper will
respond with status code 503.

The probability of rejection is calculated by the following equation:

$$ P_{reject} = ( { n_{total} - { n_{success} \over threshold } \over n_{total} + 1} )^{ exponent } $$

Examples:

    admissionControl(metricSuffix, mode, d, windowSize, minRPS, successThreshold, maxRejectProbability, exponent)
    admissionControl("myapp", "active", "1s", 5, 10, 0.95, 0.9, 0.5)

Parameters:

* metric suffix (string)
* mode (enum)
* d (time.Duration)
* window size (int)
* minRps (int)
* success threshold (float64)
* max reject probability (float64)
* exponent (float64)

Metric suffix is the chosen suffix key to expose reject counter,
should be unique by filter instance

Mode has 3 different possible values:

* "active" will reject traffic
* "inactive" will never reject traffic
* "logInactive" will not reject traffic, but log to debug filter settings

D the time duration of a single slot for required counters in our
circular buffer of window size.

Window size is the size of the circular buffer. It is used to snapshot
counters to calculate total requests and number of success. It is
within $[1, 100]$.

MinRps is the minimum requests per second that have to pass this filter
otherwise it will not reject traffic.

Success threshold sets the lowest request success rate at which the
filter will not reject requests. It is within $(0,1]$. A value of
0.95 means an error rate of lower than 5% will not trigger
rejects.

Max reject probability sets the upper bound of reject probability. It
is within (0,1]. A value of 0.95 means if backend errors with 100% it
will only reject up to 95%.

exponent is used to dictate the rejection probability. The
calculation is done by $p = p^{exponent}$
The exponent value is within $(0,\infty]$, to increase rejection
probability you have to use values lower than 1:

* 1: linear
* 1/2: quadratic
* 1/3: cubic

## Logs
### <del>accessLogDisabled</del>

**Deprecated:** use [disableAccessLog](#disableaccesslog) or [enableAccessLog](#enableaccesslog)

The `accessLogDisabled` filter overrides global Skipper `AccessLogDisabled` setting for a specific route, which allows to either turn-off
the access log for specific route while access log, in general, is enabled or vice versa.

Example:

```
accessLogDisabled("false")
```

### disableAccessLog

Filter overrides global Skipper `AccessLogDisabled` setting and allows to turn-off the access log for specific route
while access log, in general, is enabled. It is also possible to disable access logs only for a subset of response codes
from backend by providing an optional list of response code prefixes.

Parameters:

* response code prefixes (variadic int) - optional

Example:

```
disableAccessLog()
disableAccessLog(1, 301, 40)
```

This disables logs of all requests with status codes `1xxs`, `301` and all `40xs`.

### enableAccessLog

Filter overrides global Skipper `AccessLogDisabled` setting and allows to turn-on the access log for specific route
while access log, in general, is disabled. It is also possible to enable access logs only for a subset of response codes
from backend by providing an optional list of response code prefixes.

Parameters:

* response code prefixes (variadic int) - optional

Example:

```
enableAccessLog()
enableAccessLog(1, 301, 20)
```

This enables logs of all requests with status codes `1xxs`, `301` and all `20xs`.

### auditLog

Filter `auditLog()` logs the request and N bytes of the body into the
log file. N defaults to 1024 and can be overridden with
`-max-audit-body=<int>`. `N=0` omits logging the body.

Example:

```
auditLog()
```

### unverifiedAuditLog

Filter `unverifiedAuditLog()` adds a Header, `X-Unverified-Audit`, to the request, the content of which, will also
be written to the log file. By default, the value of the audit header will be equal to the value of the `sub` key, from
the Authorization token. This can be changed by providing a `string` input to the filter which matches another key from the
token.

*N.B.* It is important to note that, if the content of the `X-Unverified-Audit` header does not match the following regex, then
a default value of `invalid-sub` will be populated in the header instead:
    `^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:?=&%@.#-]*$`

Examples:

```
unverifiedAuditLog()
```

```
unverifiedAuditLog("azp")
```

## Backend
### backendIsProxy

Notifies the proxy that the backend handling this request is also a
proxy. The proxy type is based in the URL scheme which can be either
`http`, `https` or `socks5`.

Keep in mind that Skipper currently cannot handle `CONNECT` requests
by tunneling the traffic to the target destination, however, the
`CONNECT` requests can be forwarded to a different proxy using this
filter.


Example:

```
foo1:
  *
  -> backendIsProxy()
  -> "http://proxy.example.com";

foo2:
  *
  -> backendIsProxy()
  -> <roundRobin, "http://proxy1.example.com", "http://proxy2.example.com">;

foo3:
  *
  -> setDynamicBackendUrl("http://proxy.example.com")
  -> backendIsProxy()
  -> <dynamic>;
```

### setDynamicBackendHostFromHeader

* header name (string)

Example:

```
foo: * -> setDynamicBackendHostFromHeader("X-Forwarded-Host") -> <dynamic>;
```

### setDynamicBackendSchemeFromHeader

Filter sets the backend scheme for a route, value is taken from the provided header.
Can be used only with `<dynamic>` backend. Meant to be used together with [setDynamicBackendHostFromHeader](#setdynamicbackendhostfromheader)
or [setDynamicBackendHost](#setdynamicbackendhost). If this filter chained together with
[setDynamicBackendUrlFromHeader](#setdynamicbackendurlfromheader) or [setDynamicBackendUrl](#setdynamicbackendurl), the latter ones would have priority.

Parameters:

* header name (string)

Example:

```
foo: * -> setDynamicBackendSchemeFromHeader("X-Forwarded-Proto") -> <dynamic>;
```

### setDynamicBackendUrlFromHeader

Filter sets the backend url for a route, value is taken from the provided header.
Can be used only with `<dynamic>` backend.

Parameters:

* header name (string)

Example:

```

```

### setDynamicBackendHost

Filter sets the backend host for a route. Can be used only with `<dynamic>` backend.
Meant to be used together with [setDynamicBackendSchemeFromHeader](#setdynamicbackendschemefromheader)
or [setDynamicBackendScheme](#setdynamicbackendscheme). If this filter chained together with [setDynamicBackendUrlFromHeader](#setdynamicbackendurlfromheader)
or [setDynamicBackendUrl](#setdynamicbackendurl), the latter ones would have priority.

Parameters:

* host (string)

Example:

```
foo: * -> setDynamicBackendHost("example.com") -> <dynamic>;
```

### setDynamicBackendScheme

Filter sets the backend scheme for a route. Can be used only with `<dynamic>` backend.
Meant to be used together with [setDynamicBackendHostFromHeader](#setdynamicbackendhostfromheader)
or [setDynamicBackendHost](#setdynamicbackendhost). If this filter chained together with

```

### setDynamicBackendUrl

Filter sets the backend url for a route. Can be used only with `<dynamic>` backend.

Parameters:

* url (string)

Example:

```
foo: * -> setDynamicBackendUrl("https://example.com") -> <dynamic>;
```

## apiUsageMonitoring

The `apiUsageMonitoring` filter adds API related metrics to the Skipper monitoring. It is by default not activated. Activate
it by providing the `-enable-api-usage-monitoring` flag at Skipper startup. In its deactivated state, it is still
registered as a valid filter (allowing route configurations to specify it), but will perform no operation. That allows,
per instance, production environments to use it and testing environments not to while keeping the same route configuration
for all environments.

For the client based metrics, additional flags need to be specified.

| Flag                                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

NOTE: Make sure to activate the metrics flavour proper to your environment using the `metrics-flavour`
flag in order to get those metrics.

Example:

```bash
skipper -metrics-flavour prometheus -enable-api-usage-monitoring -api-usage-monitoring-realm-keys="realm" -api-usage-monitoring-client-keys="managed-id" api-usage-monitoring-realms-tracking-pattern="services,users"
```

The structure of the metrics is all of those elements, separated by `.` dots:

| Part                        | Description                                                                                           |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

#### Client Related Metrics

Those metrics are not identifying endpoint (path) and HTTP verb. They always have `*` as their place.

Example:

```
                                                            + HTTP Verb

| Counter | `latency_sum`   | sum of seconds (in decimal form) between the first observable moment (a call to the filter's `Request`) until the last (a call to the filter's `Response`) |

### Filter Configuration

Endpoints can be monitored using the `apiUsageMonitoring` filter in the route. It accepts JSON objects (as strings)
of the format mentioned below. In case any of the required parameters is missing, `no-op` filter is created, i.e. no
metrics are captured, but the creation of the route does not fail.

```yaml
api-usage-monitoring-configuration:
  type: object
  required:
    - application_id
    - api_id
    - path_templates
  properties:
    application_id:
      type: string
      description: ID of the application
      example: order-service
    tag:
      type: string
      description: tag of the application
      example: staging
    api_id:
      type: string
      description: ID of the API
      example: orders-api
    path_templates:
      description: Endpoints to be monitored.
      type: array
      minLength: 1
      items:
        type: string
        description: >
          Path template in /articles/{article-id} (OpenAPI 3) or in /articles/:article-id format.
          NOTE: They will be normalized to the :this format for metrics naming.
        example: /orders/{order-id}
    client_tracking_pattern:
        description: >
            The pattern that matches client id in form of a regular expression.

            By default (if undefined), it is set to `.*`.

            An empty string disables the client metrics completely.
        type: string
        examples:
            all_services:
                summary: All services are tracked (for all activated realms).
                value: ".*"
            just_some_services:
                summary: Only services `orders-service` and `shipment-service` are tracked.
                value: "(orders\-service|shipment\-service)"
```

Configuration Example:

```
apiUsageMonitoring(`
    {
        "application_id": "my-app",
        "tag": "staging",
        "api_id": "orders-api",
        "path_templates": [
            "foo/orders",
            "foo/orders/:order-id",
            "foo/orders/:order-id/order_item/{order-item-id}"
        ],
        "client_tracking_pattern": "(shipping\-service|payment\-service)"
    }`,`{
        "application_id": "my-app",
        "api_id": "customers-api",
        "path_templates": [
            "/foo/customers/",
            "/foo/customers/{customer-id}/"
        ]
    }
`)
```

Based on the previous configuration, here is an example of a counter metric.

```
apiUsageMonitoring.custom.my-app.staging.orders-api.GET.foo/orders/{order-id}.*.*.http_count
```

Note that a missing `tag` in the configuration will be replaced by `{no-tag}` in the metric:

```
apiUsageMonitoring.custom.my-app.{no-tag}.customers-api.GET.foo/customers.*.*.http_count
```

Here is the _Prometheus_ query to obtain it.

```
sum(rate(skipper_custom_total{key="apiUsageMonitoring.custom.my-app.staging.orders-api.GET.foo/orders/{order-id}.*.*.http_count"}[60s])) by (key)
```

Here is an example of a histogram metric.

```
apiUsageMonitoring.custom.my_app.staging.orders-api.POST.foo/orders.latency
```

Here is the _Prometheus_ query to obtain it.

```
histogram_quantile(0.5, sum(rate(skipper_custom_duration_seconds_bucket{key="apiUsageMonitoring.custom.my-app.staging.orders-api.POST.foo/orders.*.*.latency"}[60s])) by (le, key))
```

NOTE: Non configured paths will be tracked with `{unknown}` Application ID, Tag, API ID
and path template.

However, if all `application_id`s of your configuration refer to the same application,
the filter assume that also non configured paths will be directed to this application.
E.g.:

```
apiUsageMonitoring.custom.my-app.{unknown}.{unknown}.GET.{no-match}.*.*.http_count
```

## originMarker

This filter is used to measure the time it took to create a route. Other than that, it's a no-op.
You can include the same origin marker when you re-create the route. As long as the `origin` and `id` are the same, the route creation time will not be measured again.
If there are multiple origin markers with the same origin, the earliest timestamp will be used.

Parameters:

* the name of the origin
* the ID of the object that is the logical source for the route
* the creation timestamp (rfc3339)

Example:

```
originMarker("apiUsageMonitoring", "deployment1", "2019-08-30T09:55:51Z")
```

## Scheduler
### fifo

This Filter is similar to the [lifo](#lifo) filter in regards to
parameters and status codes.

It turned out that `lifo()` filter can hurt performance at high load.
On AWS instance c6g.8xlarge [lifo](#lifo) filter had a limit of 21000
requests per second on a single instance. The `fifo()` filter had not
hit a limit at 30000 requests per second.
If you use TCP-LIFO, then request processing is already in LIFO style.

Parameters:

* MaxConcurrency specifies how many goroutines are allowed to work on this queue (int)
* MaxQueueSize sets the queue size (int)
* Timeout sets the timeout to get request scheduled (time)

Example:

```
fifo(100, 150, "10s")
```

### fifoWithBody

This Filter is similar to the [lifo](#lifo) filter in regards to
parameters and status codes.
Performance considerations are similar to [fifo](#fifo).

The difference between fifo and fifoWithBody is that fifo will decrement
the concurrency as soon as the backend sent response headers and
fifoWithBody will decrement the concurrency if the response body was
served. Normally both are very similar, but if you have a fully async
component that serves multiple website fragments, this would decrement
concurrency too early.

Parameters:

* MaxConcurrency specifies how many goroutines are allowed to work on this queue (int)
* MaxQueueSize sets the queue size (int)
* Timeout sets the timeout to get request scheduled (time)

Example:

```
fifoWithBody(100, 150, "10s")
```

### lifo

This Filter changes skipper to handle the route with a bounded last in
first out queue (LIFO), instead of an unbounded first in first out
queue (FIFO). The default skipper scheduler is based on Go net/http
package, which provides an unbounded FIFO request handling. If you
enable this filter the request scheduling will change to a LIFO.  The
idea of a LIFO queue is based on Dropbox bandaid proxy, which is not
opensource. Dropbox shared their idea in a
[public blogpost](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2018/03/meet-bandaid-the-dropbox-service-proxy/).
All bounded scheduler filters will respond requests with server status error
codes in case of overrun.

All scheduler filters return HTTP status code:

- 502, if the specified timeout is reached, because a request could not be scheduled fast enough
- 503, if the queue is full

Parameters:

* MaxConcurrency specifies how many goroutines are allowed to work on this queue(int)
* MaxQueueSize sets the queue size (int)
* Timeout sets the timeout to get request scheduled (time)

Example:

```
lifo(100, 150, "10s")
```

The above configuration will set MaxConcurrency to 100, MaxQueueSize
to 150 and Timeout to 10 seconds.

When there are multiple lifo filters on the route, only the last one will be applied.

### lifoGroup

This filter is similar to the [lifo](#lifo) filter.

Parameters:

* GroupName to group multiple one or many routes to the same queue, which have to have the same settings (string)
* MaxConcurrency specifies how many goroutines are allowed to work on this queue(int)
* MaxQueueSize sets the queue size (int)
* Timeout sets the timeout to get request scheduled (time)

Example:

```
lifoGroup("mygroup", 100, 150, "10s")
```

The above configuration will set MaxConcurrency to 100, MaxQueueSize
to 150 and Timeout to 10 seconds for the lifoGroup "mygroup", that can
be shared between multiple routes.

It is enough to set the concurrency, queue size and timeout parameters for one instance of
the filter in the group, and only the group name for the rest. Setting these values for
multiple instances is fine, too. While only one of them will be used as the source for the
applied settings, if there is accidentally a difference between the settings in the same
group, a warning will be logged.

It is possible to use the lifoGroup filter together with the single lifo filter, e.g. if
a route belongs to a group, but needs to have additional stricter settings then the whole
group.

## RFC Compliance
### rfcHost

This filter removes the optional trailing dot in the outgoing host
header.


Example:

```
rfcHost()
```


### rfcPath

This filter forces an alternative interpretation of the RFC 2616 and RFC 3986 standards,
where paths containing reserved characters will have these characters unescaped when the
incoming request also has them unescaped.

Example:

```
Path("/api/*id) -> rfcPath() -> "http://api-backend"
```

In the above case, if the incoming request has something like foo%2Fbar in the id
position, the api-backend service will also receive it in the format foo%2Fbar, while
without the rfcPath() filter the outgoing request path will become /api/foo/bar.

In case we want to use the id while routing the request, we can use the <loopback>
backend. Example:

```
api: Path("/api/:id") -> setPath("/api/${id}/summary") -> "http://api-backend";
patch: Path("/api/*id") -> rfcPath() -> <loopback>;
```

In the above case, if the incoming request path is /api/foo%2Fbar, it will match
the 'patch' route, and then the patched request will match the api route, and
the api-backend service will receive a request with the path /api/foo%2Fbar/summary.

It is also possible to enable this behavior centrally for a Skipper instance with
the -rfc-patch-path flag. See
[URI standards interpretation](../operation/operation.md#uri-standards-interpretation).

## Egress

### setRequestHeaderFromSecret

This filter sets request header to the secret value with optional prefix and suffix.
This is only for use cases using skipper as sidecar to inject tokens for the application on the
[**egress**](egress.md) path, if it's used in the **ingress** path you likely
create a security issue for your application.

This filter should be used as an [egress](egress.md) only feature.

Parameters:

* header name (string)
* secret name (string)
* value prefix (string) - optional
* value suffix (string) - optional

Example:

```
egress1: Method("GET") -> setRequestHeaderFromSecret("Authorization", "/tmp/secrets/get-token") -> "https://api.example.com";
egress2: Method("POST") -> setRequestHeaderFromSecret("Authorization", "/tmp/secrets/post-token", "foo-") -> "https://api.example.com";
egress3: Method("PUT") -> setRequestHeaderFromSecret("X-Secret", "/tmp/secrets/put-token", "bar-", "-baz") -> "https://api.example.com";
```

To use `setRequestHeaderFromSecret` filter you need to run skipper
with `-credentials-paths=/tmp/secrets` and specify an update interval `-credentials-update-interval=10s`.
Files in the credentials path can be a directory, which will be able to find all files within this
directory, but it won't walk subtrees.
For the example case, there have to be `get-token`, `post-token` and `put-token` files within the
specified credential paths `/tmp/secrets/`, resulting in
`/tmp/secrets/get-token`, `/tmp/secrets/post-token` and `/tmp/secrets/put-token`.

### bearerinjector

This filter injects `Bearer` tokens into `Authorization` headers read
from file providing the token as content.

It is a special form of `setRequestHeaderFromSecret` with `"Authorization"` header name,
`"Bearer "` prefix and empty suffix.

Example:

```
egress: * -> bearerinjector("/tmp/secrets/my-token") -> "https://api.example.com";

// equivalent to setRequestHeaderFromSecret("Authorization", "/tmp/secrets/my-token", "Bearer ")
```

## Open Tracing
### tracingBaggageToTag

This filter adds an opentracing tag for a given baggage item in the trace.

Syntax:
```
tracingBaggageToTag("<baggage_item_name>", "<tag_name>")
```

Example: If a trace consists of baggage item named `foo` with a value `bar`. Adding below filter will add a tag named `baz` with value `bar`
```
tracingBaggageToTag("foo", "baz")
```

### stateBagToTag

This filter sets an opentracing tag from the filter context (state bag).
If the provided key (first parameter) cannot be found in the state bag, then it doesn't set the tag.

Parameters:

* key in the state bag (string)
* tag name (string)

The route in the following example checks whether the request is authorized with the
oauthTokeninfoAllScope() filter. This filter stores the authenticated user with "auth-user"
key in the context, and the stateBagToTag() filter in the next step stores it in
the opentracing tag "client_id":

```
foo: * -> oauthTokeninfoAllScope("address_service.all") -> stateBagToTag("auth-user", "client_id") -> "https://backend.example.org";
```

### tracingTag

This filter adds an opentracing tag.

Syntax:
```
tracingTag("<tag_name>", "<tag_value>")
```

Tag value may contain [template placeholders](#template-placeholders).
If a template placeholder can't be resolved then filter does not set the tag.

Example: Adding the below filter will add a tag named `foo` with the value `bar`.
```
tracingTag("foo", "bar")
```

Example: Set tag from request header
```
tracingTag("http.flow_id", "${request.header.X-Flow-Id}")
```

### tracingTagFromResponse

This filter works just like [tracingTag](#tracingtag), but is applied after the request was processed. In particular, [template placeholders](#template-placeholders) referencing the response can be used in the parameters.

### tracingSpanName

This filter sets the name of the outgoing (client span) in opentracing. The default name is "proxy". Example:

```
tracingSpanName("api-operation")
```

## Load Balancing

Some filters influence how load balancing will be done

### fadeIn

When this filter is set, and the route has a load balanced backend using [supported algorithm](backends.md#load-balancer-backend),
then the newly added endpoints will receive
the traffic in a gradually increasing way, starting from their detection for the specified duration, after which
they receive equal amount traffic as the previously existing routes. The detection time of an load balanced
backend endpoint is preserved over multiple generations of the route configuration (over route changes). This
filter can be used to saturate the load of autoscaling applications that require a warm-up time and therefore a
smooth ramp-up. The fade-in feature can be used together with the roundRobin, random  or consistentHash LB algorithms.

While the default fade-in curve is linear, the optional exponent parameter can be used to adjust the shape of
the fade-in curve, based on the following equation:

current_rate = proportional_rate * min((now - detected) / duration, 1) ^ exponent

Parameters:

* duration: duration of the fade-in in milliseconds or as a duration string
* fade-in curve exponent - optional: a floating point number, default: 1

Examples:

```
fadeIn("3m")
fadeIn("3m", 1.5)
```

#### Warning on fadeIn and Rolling Restarts

Traffic fade-in has the potential to skew the traffic to your backend pods in case of a rolling restart
(`kubectl rollout restart`), because it is very likely that the rolling restart is going faster than the
fade-in duration. The image below shows an example of a rolling restart for a four-pod deployment (A, B, C, D)
into (E, F, G, H), and the traffic share of each pod over time. While the ramp-up of the new pods is ongoing,
the remaining old pods will receive a largely increased traffic share (especially the last one, D in this
example), as well as an over-propotional traffic share for the first pod in the rollout (E).

To make rolling restarts safe, you need to slow them down by setting `spec.minReadySeconds` on the pod spec
of your deployment or stackset, according to your fadeIn duration.

![Rolling Restart and Fade-In](../img/fadein_traffic_skew.png)

### endpointCreated

This filter marks the creation time of a load balanced endpoint. When used together with the fadeIn
filter, it prevents missing the detection of a new backend instance with the same hostname. This filter is
typically automatically appended, and it's parameters are based on external sources, e.g. the Kubernetes API.

Parameters:

* the address of the endpoint
* timestamp, either as a number of seconds since the unix epocs, or a string in RFC3339 format

Example:

```
endpointCreated("http://10.0.0.1:8080", "2020-12-18T15:30:00Z01:00")
```

### consistentHashKey

This filter sets the request key used by the [`consistentHash`](backends.md#load-balancer-backend) algorithm to select the backend endpoint.

Parameters:

* key (string)

The key should contain [template placeholders](#template-placeholders), without placeholders the key
is constant and therefore all requests would be made to the same endpoint.
The algorithm will use the default key if any of the template placeholders can't be resolved.

Examples:

```
pr: Path("/products/:productId")
    -> consistentHashKey("${productId}")
    -> <consistentHash, "http://127.0.0.1:9998", "http://127.0.0.1:9997">;
```
```
consistentHashKey("${request.header.Authorization}")
consistentHashKey("${request.source}") // same as the default key
```

### consistentHashBalanceFactor

This filter sets the balance factor used by the [`consistentHash`](backends.md#load-balancer-backend) algorithm to prevent a single backend endpoint from being overloaded.
The number of in-flight requests for an endpoint can be no higher than `(average-in-flight-requests * balanceFactor) + 1`.
This is helpful in the case where certain keys are very popular and threaten to overload the endpoint they are mapped to.
[Further Details](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/consistent-hashing-with-bounded-loads.html).

Parameters:

* balanceFactor: A float or int, must be >= 1

Examples:

```
pr: Path("/products/:productId")
    -> consistentHashKey("${productId}")
    -> consistentHashBalanceFactor(1.25)
    -> <consistentHash, "http://127.0.0.1:9998", "http://127.0.0.1:9997">;
```
```
consistentHashBalanceFactor(3)
```
